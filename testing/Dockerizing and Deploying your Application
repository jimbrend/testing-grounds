BUILDING IMAGE

⦁	Install docker, download docker for Windows here:
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

⦁	Sign up for a docker account here:
https://hub.docker.com/signup

(Remember the username that you pick)

⦁	Open and watch the first video, there is shown how to build the image.

Notice the command used in the video:  docker build -t aarenasjs/musicbot .

The aarenasjs part is the docker username, replace that with your own username.


⦁	Open and watch the second video, there I show how to push your image to the docker hub (cloud), so you can then call that image from umbrelOS.

Use your username and password to login, like you see in the video, and then proceed in same way I shown there to push the image to your docker account.


If everything went correctly, you should see the image in your docker dashboard.
